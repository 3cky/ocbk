# Peripherals — keyboard and the cartridge slot

`src/peripheral/` minus the SMK512 storage devices ([smk512.md](smk512.md)) and
`bk_evnt.sv` ([video.md](video.md)); sound devices live in
[audio.md](audio.md).

## Keyboard

- **Keyboard (Phase 6):** `ps2_rx` → `kbd_ps2bk` (translator, all on
  `cpu_clk`) → `bk_kbd014` (the 1801ВП1-014 bus equivalent at 177660–177663,
  decode = the 037's `PIN_nBS`, netlist-contract-validated — see
  `sim/ref014/README.md` for the full pinned contract). Key facts:
  - **the 014 readme's "nEC1 = РУС/ЛАТ" label is imprecise for the BK**: the
    schematic wires nEC1 to the trigger flipped by the ЗАГЛ/СТР keys (caps),
    while РУС/ЛАТ are ordinary matrix keys emitting 016/017 — mapped here as
    CapsLock = the ЗАГЛ/СТР trigger, LCtrl = РУС, Home = ЛАТ, Insert = СУ
    (held), either Shift = НР, either Alt = АР2, **Delete = СТОП**,
    **Print Screen = screen_mode toggle** and **F12 = turbo toggle** (both
    radial control outputs like СТОП, never a matrix code, power-on-only —
    see the screen_mode note and the turbo bullet; F12 is scancode 0x07,
    single byte, and its branch is `!got_e0`-guarded because the F-key rows
    in the code table are written E0-agnostic;
    Scroll Lock is now unused — CMT tape mode moved to **DIP 4**, see the
    tape note);
  - case algebra per BkEmu (`latin ^ (caps | shift)` on letters, СУ = `&037`
    on 01xx codes); the **silicon auto-274 code group**
    {0,1,2,4,5,6,7,011,013,021} vectors to 0274 without АР2 (measured over
    the netlist matrix scan — MiSTer's arrow flags were wrong);
  - **СТОП is trap-to-4 on a BK-0010 with BASIC** (per the schematic/user):
    nothing decodes 177674/177676, the HALT entry's PC/PSW stores bus-timeout
    (`qbto`, 56..63 clocks) and the CPU traps through RAM vector 4 — the
    160002 word is never used as a vector. `qbus_mem`'s I/O decode is the
    CPU's own nSEL1/nSEL2 pins (177716/177714 only — the registers whose read
    data `ad_oe` delegates externally; everything else in the I/O page,
    177674/76 included, is undecoded and bus-times-out, exactly as a real BK);
    never "helpfully" reply there. СТОП itself is a fixed 64-cpu_clk one-shot
    on nIRQ1. **Phase 7 (BK-0011M): 177716 write bit 12 = СТОП-block**
    (1 = blocked, write-only, `stop_block` in `qbus_mem` gating the one-shot
    launch in `ocbk_top`) — MiSTer's lane rule, matching the real board's
    WR1/WR2 byte-strobe registers: only a write that strobes the HIGH byte
    (word, or the 177717 odd byte) with the bit-11 lane clear touches it;
    low-byte writes never do (BkEmu's implicit re-enable there is a rejected
    emulator artifact). bk11-only (bk10 has no latch), **DCLO-only reset**
    (the map/662 exception: RESET must not re-enable СТОП). Pinned by
    `spk_capture_tb` + `sim/bk11` section 13; that oracle also documents
    that the aborted HALT entry pushes a mid-instruction PC — the trap-4
    frame is NOT RTI-able (real СТОП handlers never return);
  - `N_KBD`/`N_IAK` = 1 (the async chip replies within the strobe cycle) and
    the 177660 **write** reply is combinational (`wr_fast`) — both pinned by
    `golden_kbd.txt`; vm1 slaves must hold read data past DIN release (the
    IAK vector capture relies on it — bus-charge physics on the real board).

## Cartridge slot

- Cartridge-slot Q-bus is a **forward seam**: `src/bus/qbus_slot.sv`, default
  `SLOT_ENABLE=0` (drives nothing, slot pins stay reserved-tristated). The full
  slot pin map lives commented in `ocbk_common.qsf`. Real BK hardware needs an
  external 5V↔3.3V level-shifter (Cyclone I is not 5V-tolerant).
